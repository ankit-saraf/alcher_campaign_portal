# Man Shakti web portal
In this trying time of a global pandemic (Covid-19), we have the comfort of staying safe at home with our loved ones but not everyone is afforded this luxury. Everyday, members of our health care staff put their lives at risk, fighting this global pandemic, helping us. It is difficult to imagine how stressful it must be for them. We do not have the medical expertise to do anything about Covid-19 but we can help and support them by showing our gratitude to them, telling them that we recognise their efforts and are forever grateful for the efforts and risks they are facing to help us.
This portal was designed so that public can send their love via messages to the covid-warriors.

It is a single webpage built in Django framework.
